                  It’s a hot, dry and windy day—typical for January in Baidoa, Somalia. For six years, 45-year-old Udugow and her family have been living in the camp. Severe drought drove them from their home in the Wajid district, about 90 kilometres away.

                  Udugow has another specific worry that weighs on her heart: her daughter, Faduma. Since Faduma’s husband abandoned her and her children, they now live with Udugow and Ibrahim.

                  A water collection point 100 metres from her home, funded by Global Affairs Canada, has provided a constant flow of water ever since they’ve lived here. Udugow says she collects six 20-litre containers every day.
